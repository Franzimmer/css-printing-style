              Malaysia’s tropical waters are teeming with life – these
              organisations are inviting visitors to help keep it that way. In
              the deep blue tropical waters of Malaysia, the elusive whale shark
              is almost mythological in its lore. Considered to be the largest
              fish in the ocean – growing to roughly the size of a small bus and
              covered in beautiful white spots on its back, these majestic
              creatures are a sight to behold, and encountering them is even
              believed to be a good luck charm in some parts of the world.
              Snorkellers and divers in Malaysia have been pleasantly surprised
              by these curious gentle giants that often come up close to the
              surface to feed on plankton. They can be sighted in seas around
              the country: in Sabah from March to April, and on the east coast
              of Malaysia between July and October. This is unsurprising,
              considering Malaysia is part of the Coral Triangle – an area which
              spans six countries in South East Asia and the Pacific, and is
              home to around 600 different species of coral, and more than 2,000
              types of reef fish, making it a highly desirable scuba diving and
              snorkelling destination.While checking ‘swimming with whale
              sharks’ off your list could be a tall order, Malaysia’s coasts are
              rich in other spectacular marine life living just below the waves,
              offering visitors even more than crystal blue waters and scenic
              beaches. Culture in conservation On the east coast of Malaysia,
              areas of Terengganu are an especially important destination for
              nesting green sea turtles and hawksbill turtles. They’re
              frequently found visiting the beaches between mainland Chakar
              Hutan and the islands of Lang Tengah and Perhentian between the
              months of March and October to lay their eggs. However, with
              rising sea levels and higher temperatures affecting the
              female-male ratio of turtles (hotter temperatures during
              incubation produce more females, while cooler temperatures produce
              male hatchlings) along with other factors, turtle populations
              across the globe are in decline. Raphe van Zevenbergen, co-Founder
              and director of Lang Tengah Turtle Watch (LTTW), says his
              organisation strives to “protect and repopulate the remaining
              endangered and critically endangered species by blending
              responsible tourism and outreach initiatives with our practical
              turtle and coral work and research”. “Each of our diverse project
              sites takes on its own localised approach, maximising its own
              impact whilst collectively achieving our broader conservation
              goals. A turtle returning to the sea.png Areas of Terengganu are

              hawksbill turtles. Photo credit: LTTW From tirelessly patrolling
              beaches at night until the early hours of the morning and
              collecting data, to driving awareness through talks and
              volunteerism, LTTW works hard to live – and share – its message of
              conservation. While balancing the culture and livelihoods within
              local communities, the organisation also reaches out to those
              travellers and tourists who are seeking ways to be more involved
              in their environment while on holiday. In partnership with the
              idyllic Tanjong Jara Resort, guests are able to adopt turtle nests
              at their on-site hatchery, receive updates, as well as book a stay
              to coincide with a hatchling release – all done with minimal
              interaction between man and animal. LTTW also focuses on cultural
              conservation, honouring traditional craftsmanship and the use of
              reclaimed building materials. The Resthouse, for example, was a
              wooden house built by the British government in the 1940s now
              painstakingly restored with salvaged materials. Awarded Airbnb’s
              Green Stays award, the house, which runs predominantly on solar
              power, donates a portion of its proceeds towards LTTW’s turtle
              conservation efforts while educating eco-curious guests. “The
              turtles are emblematic in Terengganu and, thus, are inextricably
              tied to the communal identity of the state,” adds Raphe. “Through
              our outreach programmes, we celebrate turtles being at the
              forefront of Terengganu culture and aim to redefine the narrative
              surrounding them to one of preservation – whilst contributing to
              the local economy. In doing so, we are ensuring that generations
              to come can continue to share this special coastline, anchored
              with n historical identity, from the arts to nature.” Underwater
              coral cities designed to protect In understanding what makes these
              islands so rich in biodiversity, it is important to note the role
              of coral reefs in providing a home and nursery ground for around
              20% of all marine life, which in turn provides communities along
              the coast a source of food and income, and also attracts tourists.
              The reefs also offer many lesser known – but just as vital –
              benefits such as absorbing wave energy and reducing coastal
              erosion. Despite the challenges of pollution, marine debris, and
              physical damage to the reef, it is heartwarming that organisations
              such as Reef Check Malaysia (RCM) are taking steps to preserve
              these underwater cities. On Tioman island, local residents have
              been trained to monitor the coral reefs.png On Tioman island,
              local residents have been trained to monitor the coral reefs. At
              Tioman island, just off the coast of Pahang, stunning coral reefs,
              nudibranchs (commonly known as sea slugs), reef sharks, turtles,
              and even manta rays are often sighted, making this a prime
              destination for holidaymakers looking to experience these marine
              wonderlands. Home to a collection of luxury 4-star resorts, plenty
              of dive schools and a local village, RCM has been working to
              ensure that all stakeholders on the island work towards a common
              goal: ensuring a more symbiotic relationship between man and
              nature. Efforts include working toward coral reef resilience by
              encouraging the local community to actively participate in
              conservation and management of marine ecosystems around the
              island. Initiatives include creating a supplementary income for
              locals by reducing dependency on the reef and providing training
              in hospitality and tourism. “Over the years, RCM has taught more
              than 80 islanders how to scuba dive, conduct surveys to monitor
              coral bleaching, coral predator outbreaks and to monitor the
              general health of reefs around the island,” says Alvin Chelliah,
              marine biologist at Reef Check Malaysia. “Known as the Tioman
              Marine Conservation Group, we actively rehabilitate damaged coral
              reefs and install mooring buoys to stop people from anchoring on
              reefs.” Reef Check Malaysia works hard to rejuvenate coral reefs
              in the Tioman Marine Park.png Reef Check Malaysia works hard to
              rejuvenate coral reefs in the Tioman Marine Park. Having planted
              more than 1,800 corals just in 2022, RCM has also located and
              removed more than 35 ghost nets (abandoned fishing nets) weighing
              over 7,000kg and helped address other issues such as solid waste
              pollution by setting up recycling collection centres around the
              island. “We have seen a change in mindset and greater involvement
              of local islanders in conservation and management of the Tioman
              marine park,” says Alvin. “Today, many of the local communities
              are actively participating in conservation efforts and want to be
              included in management decision making.” In their role as
              strategic partners in management with the Department of Fisheries,
              RCM has also introduced responsible tourism programmes such as the
              ASEAN Green Hotels for resorts and now replicates this model to
              train local groups on other islands in the country. As above, so
              below One cannot mention marine life in Malaysia without
              acknowledging the stunning landscapes of Borneo, both above and
              below the shoreline. Kota Kinabalu in Sabah is home to both the
              tallest mountain in Malaysia and the picturesque Tunku Abdul
              Rahman Marine Park, which was gazetted in 1974 as Sabah’s second
              national park and covers an area of 50 square kilometres.
              Comprising five islands and their surrounding reefs and sea, the
              park was formed with the objective of protecting the abundant
              fauna, flora, and marine ecosystems. Recognising this, Gaya Island
              Resort – set within the park – launched the Gaya Island Resort
              Marine Centre (GIRMC) in 2013, in an effort to lead the community
              in marine conservation projects by advocating for three key
              pillars: turtle rescue, coral reef restoration and conservation
              through education. Understanding that it takes strength in
              numbers, GIRMC has partnered with the Sabah Wildlife Department,
              Loggerhead Marinelife Center, Marine Research Foundation (MRF) and
              Sabah Parks Department to create Malaysia’s first dedicated Sea
              Turtle Rescue Centre. “Without these partnerships it would have
              been impossible for us to find the balance between conservation,
              tourism, and local regulations,” says Scott Mayback, resident
              marine biologist at GIRMC. “While we are still experimenting with
              a number of techniques, our success is evident in the reshaping of
              our marine habitat.” In its 10 years of operation, GIRMC has
              rescued 26 sea turtles, most notably long-term resident Covid, a
              green sea turtle who was hit by a boat and rescued by the
              conservation team during the pandemic. Besides rehabilitating
              Covid, the conservation division, led by its director Justin
              Juhun, has also taken on an active role in replanting corals, sea
              grass and mangroves. The Gaya Island Resort Marine Centre replants
              coral to support marine ecosystems.png The Gaya Island Resort
              Marine Centre replants coral to support marine ecosystems. “With
              the popularisation of marine preservation and restoration through
              cutting-edge documentaries, we can see a major shift in the
              general knowledge and interest in conservation of our guests and
              it makes us proud to be a champion of conservation-based tourism,”
              says Scott. “As conservationists, more awareness is half the
              battle won.” A respite for nature lovers, the resort offers more
              than just rich biodiversity underwater, with land-based encounters
              featuring a focus on proboscis monkeys. Activities include
              wildlife sightings, mangrove kayak tours, rare flora and fauna and
              educational programmes led by the resident naturalist. With more
              learned travellers and tourists looking to understand and do more
              for the communities and environments they visit while on holiday,
              this spirit of preservation and conservation will ensure that
              nature’s beauty can continue to be celebrated and enjoyed for
              generations to come.
